### Hey there!

I'm <strong>Bart Stefanski</strong>, software engineer with a knack for shipping good and fast solutions. My coding adventure began at the age of 12, and I've since grown passionate about React, Next.js, TypeScript, Web Performance and Vercel.

Currently, I'm working as a Software Developer at [Blazity](https://blazity.com?utm_source=bstefanski.com), where I collaborate with amazing teammates and contribute to impactful projects. 🚀

In the past, I worked with Java & Spring Framework, but a couple of years ago, I made the switch to embrace the world of frontend development.

Outside of coding, I love boxing, and I'm currently learning the Mike Tyson Peek-a-Boo style. 🥊 When I'm not throwing punches, you can find me recruiting developers, writing (hopefully) helpful blog posts ✍️, having a blast watching movies at the cinema 🍿, or walking my lovely dog, Ruby. 🐶❤️

Continuous learning and growth are important to me, so I'm always looking to expand my skillset and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. 📚

Interested in discussing a project or just talking tech? Don't hesitate to reach out - I'd love to hear from you! Drop me a line at contact@bstefanski.com or connect with me on LinkedIn. 😄
