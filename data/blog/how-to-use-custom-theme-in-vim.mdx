There are numerous methods for installing a custom theme in your VIM setup, but the easiest I've found is through VimPlug. Here are the steps I followed to accomplish this:

1. Install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) 

This can be easily done by executing the following command:

```bash
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

2. Next, add vim-plug to your vim configuration, which is located in the `~/.vimrc` file (don't worry if it's empty).

You can copy and paste the following configuration file, replacing `olivercederborg/poimandres` with the theme of your choice:

```lua
call plug#begin()

Plug 'olivercederborg/poimandres.nvim'

call plug#end()
```

3. Reload your terminal.

4. Open vim, press esc, and type `:PlugInstall`. Now you're all set
