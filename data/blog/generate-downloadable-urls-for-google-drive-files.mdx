I recently uploaded numerous files to Google Drive and organized them into a directory. My goal was to obtain downloadable URLs for each file. However, I discovered that Google Drive doesn't offer this feature directly.

After some research, I stumbled upon an excellent article by Kurian George Cheripurathu - [Retrieve File Names and URLs of a Google Drive Folder using Google Apps Script and Google Sheets. Method to send personalised email attachment in bulk emails](https://medium.com/@akmkurian/retrieve-file-names-and-urls-of-a-google-drive-folder-using-google-apps-script-and-google-sheets-467955e88e7). This guide helped me immensely, solving about 90% of my problem.

The only issue was that the generated URLs led to a `View the file` modal, rather than to direct download.

I found a solution and will simplify the process here, incorporating some personal insights:

1. Navigate to Google Sheets at [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/). You might wonder why we need Sheets. It's because it's a straightforward way to display all URLs without dealing with authorization complexities you would while integrating with Google SDKs.
2. Create a new Sheet document.
3. In the top menu bar, find the `Extensions` tab (second from the right), hover over it, and click on `App Scripts`.
4. This action opens the code editor. Here, paste the following JavaScript code:

```js
function onOpen() {
  var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi()
  ui.createMenu('Get Folder Details').addItem('Retrieve Files', 'retrieveFiles').addToUi()
}

function retrieveFiles() {
  var folderLink = SpreadsheetApp.getUi().prompt('Enter the folder link').getResponseText()
  var folder = DriveApp.getFolderById(getFolderIdFromLink(folderLink))
  var files = folder.getFiles()
  var data = []

  while (files.hasNext()) {
    var file = files.next()
    var fileUrl = 'https://drive.google.com/open?id=' + file.getId()
    data.push([
      file.getName(),
      fileUrl.replace('drive.google.com/open?id=', 'drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id='),
    ])
  }

  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet()
  sheet.getRange(1, 1, data.length, data[0].length).setValues(data)

  SpreadsheetApp.getUi().alert('Files retrieved successfully.')
}

function getFolderIdFromLink(link) {
  var regex = /\/folders\/([^/?]+)/
  var match = link.match(regex)

  if (match && match[1]) {
    return match[1]
  }

  return null
}
```

This code functions similarly to the original, but with a crucial difference: it replaces `drive.google.com/open` with `drive.google.com/uc?export=download`, creating URLs that automatically download or display your files.

5. Save your changes using the diskette ðŸ’¾ icon. **There's no need to deploy or run itâ€”simply save and return to your Sheet.**
6. Refresh the Sheet. It may take a few attempts before the "Get Folder Details" menu item appears.
7. Once visible, click on it. The app will request permission accessâ€”grant it.
8. You'll encounter a warning about the app being unpublished and potentially insecure. **This is standard for private, local applications and can be safely bypassed by clicking `Advanced` and proceeding.**
9. A popup will ask for the directory link. Copy this from your Google Drive's URL bar and paste it into the prompt.
10. In a moment, the script will list all file URLs from the directory.

**Tip:** If your Google Drive and Sheets accounts differ, ensure the folder is shared with the account used for Sheets.
