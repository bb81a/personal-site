While attempting to commit with a batch of images to my Git repo, I encountered this error:

```bash
error: RPC failed; HTTP 500 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 500
send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
Writing objects: 100% (64/64), 205.66 MiB | 17.18 MiB/s, done.
Total 64 (delta 12), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly
```

This occurred because the size of the commit exceeded Git's default size limit.

To increase the limit, use the following command:

```bash
git config http.postBuffer 524288000
```

Alternatively, for SSH:

```bash
git config ssh.postBuffer 524288000
```

This setting will accommodate changes up to 500 MB. To apply this change universally, include the `â€”global` flag. For even larger files, adjust the limit as necessary.

Keep in mind, Github's maximum file size limit is **2 GiB**:

```bash
git config http.postBuffer 2147483648
```
